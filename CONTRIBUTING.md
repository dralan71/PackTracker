# Contributing to PackTracker

Thank you for considering contributing! Please read the following guidelines before opening issues or submitting pull requests.


## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Use the **Bug report** template to provide:
  - Clear description of the problem.
  - Steps to reproduce.
  - Expected vs. actual behavior.
  - Screenshots, logs, environment details.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Search existing feature requests first.
- Use the **Feature request** template to describe:
  - The problem youâ€™re trying to solve.
  - Your proposed solution.
  - Alternatives considered.

### Your First Code Contribution

1. Fork the repository  
2. Clone your fork (`git clone <your-fork-url>`)  
3. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)  
4. Make your changes locally  
5. Commit your work (`git commit -m 'feat: add my feature'`)  
6. Push to your fork (`git push origin feature/my-feature`)  
7. Open a Pull Request using the **Pull Request** template

### Coding Standards

- Follow existing code style (TypeScript, React, CSS modules).  
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test` before submitting.  
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages (see [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)).

### Branch Naming

- `fix/bug-description` for bug fixes  
- `feat/feature-description` for new features  
- `docs/update-docs` for documentation changes  
- `chore/...` for other tasks  

### Pull Request Process

- Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.  
- PR must pass CI (lint, type-check, build, tests).  
- Add reviewers and wait for approval.  
- Address review comments by pushing new commits to the same branch.  
- Once approved, your PR will be merged by a maintainer.
